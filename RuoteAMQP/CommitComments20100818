RuoteAMQP Participant  
=====================

Purpose
=======

We have a Python codebase that needs to become part of a Ruote based system.

We need a better understanding of what is required.

These changes here add a modicum of unittesting in order to enhance 
understanding.

This is my best guess, more docstrings and more 
explicit variable naming would have helped...

Bugs
====

FlowExpressionId
----------------

1. child_id

Not sure that this has been used. A couple of changes made for 
purposes of unittests.

Although it does look like there is some format expected 
for `engine_id`. Is this documented anywhere?

2. expid 

This appeads twice. I guess it is a typo

3. direct_child 

`join` is not a Python type

Workitem
--------

1. wfid 

The brackets are missing here. 
Provides a good example why properties are generally considered safer!

2. set_fields

Added an exception here inline with the docstring

3. __eq__

false is not a Python type. 
It looks like this isn't in use and I am not sure what was intended

4. __ne__

Leaving this due to problems with 4.

5. hash

A dictionary is not hashable. Is it the FlowExpressionId that needs hashing?
